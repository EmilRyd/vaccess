# Vaccess
Vaccess, an iOS app for keeping track of vaccinations. 

### Functionality
1. Lets you add your vaccination history
2. Get notifications on future vaccinations
3. Read up on vaccination advice straight from the CDC (for US users) and Folkh√§lsomynidgheten (for Swedish users)

### Background 
Developed by me, released on the App Store in US and Sweden. No longer available since 2023.
